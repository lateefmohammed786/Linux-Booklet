# Linux Level-1 Automation — Server Setup (v2)

This repo contains a Level-1 automation script that prepares basic server items and
generates documentation files for submission.

Files created by this script:
- ROADMAP.md
- README.md (this file)
- level1_report.txt
- level1_setup_v2.log

How to run:
1. Save script in your repo and make executable:
   chmod +x setup_level1_v2.sh
2. Run:
   ./setup_level1_v2.sh
   (Use sudo on Linux if you want system-level changes)

Notes:
- Run on Linux/WSL for full behavior. On Windows (Git Bash) the script will still produce
  ROADMAP.md and level1_report.txt but will skip system-level operations.
